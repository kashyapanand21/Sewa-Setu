Students at NIT Patna depend on offline vendors on Ashok Rajpath for technical books and printing.  
Group buying happens informally on WhatsApp, causing failed orders, crowding, and zero bargaining structure.

Sewa-Setu fixes this by turning scattered demand into organized bargaining power and vendor coordination.

Live demo:
I log in using Google Sign-In. My UID is written to Firestore instantly.
On the student dashboard, I create a bulk request for a technical book.
Other students join the request. Duplicate joins are blocked.
Once participants reach 10, 20, or 30, the system automatically applies 30%, 40%, or 50% discount tiers.
Admin panel confirms and completes the order safely without vendor tech involvement.

Next, the vendor locator streams verified printers and shops in realtime on OpenStreetMap using Leaflet.
No API key required, no crashes, no console errors.

Then, I create a printing slot with a 3-buyer threshold and a 2-minute expiry for demo.
A student books the slot. Duplicate booking is blocked.
When the deadline passes, a 60-second safety loop flips the slot status to expired reliably.

Finally, the discount engine outputs a structured JSON report directly in the browser console.
This proves atomic safety, caching, and tier logic work end-to-end.

Impact:
Lower cost for students, less crowding at shops, guaranteed demand for vendors, structured workflow for coordination.
That’s Sewa-Setu — a collective service bridge, not a marketplace.
